Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a mobile app game creator with experienced success launching a puzzle competition game on the Android platform. The client wanted to develop a    web-based version of its current Android app to make the game available across multiple platforms and devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
We create documents similar to this at work. We call them "runbooks" and we store all the different processes and procedures for different clients in their own runbooks. We also add notes as things change. I feel like I did well with this because I already have that practice at work. This was a relatively easy and fun project for me. It was cool to see that I am doing things in the "real world" that I am learning about in college.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
